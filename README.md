## Project Goals

The main objective is to build and compare various models for detecting fake news, ranging from simpler, interpretable algorithms to more powerful deep learning approaches.

### Approaches Implemented:

- TF-IDF + **Logistic Regression**
- TF-IDF + **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **LSTM** (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **DeBERTa** (Transformer-based model)
